## Project Update ##

Just setting up the work environment now. 
For proof of concept, it should have as follows :
- Way to enter info regarding a new system design with 5 fields (EDA, Board Used, IP, Peripheral Interfaced with IP (such as flash devices))
- Way to search and view the database on the website
- [Advanced Feature] Create drop down menu with some selections
- [Advanced Feature] Create IP utilization chart in working system designs used by customers and hobbyists. Helps better dedicate development resources towards those IP's
- Simple GUI (Will refine once MVP is achieved)
